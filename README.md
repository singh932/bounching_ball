# bounching_ball
This C Bouncing Ball Game Project shows you how to programme a basic bouncing ball game.
The ball in the console interface continues to move. When it comes into contact with the boundary, it turns around.
The ball is captured by the control stick, and the score is increased by one. If the ball isn't caught, the game is finished.
